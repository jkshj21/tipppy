# tipppy

Code Path pre-work project:

1) ViewControllerView class is tip calculator class that I followed from video tutorial 
2) SettingViewController class is the settings of tip calculator that have options to either 
        
        a) Stay on tip calculator (ViewControllerView class) or 
        b) Go to new discount calculator (discountCal class) 
        Note: If user select one of the option that another option will automatically disabled 
        
3) Similiarly, discountCal class calculate the discount amount of the original price based on discount percentage.
